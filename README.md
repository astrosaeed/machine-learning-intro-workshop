# Base2 Introduction to Machine Learning Workshop

A **Colab Jupyter Notebook** based introduction to machine learning.

Press **Start** to begin exploring the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) of the workshop within [Google's Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).  This interactive environment will allow you to edit an execute [Python Code](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/) that includes [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) frameworks directly in your browser.

You can even explore this from your Phone or Tablet, but editing will challenge your patience, probably beyond the levels of human endurance.
