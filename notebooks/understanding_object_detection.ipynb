Redmon chose this formulation because â€œsmall deviations in large boxes matter less than in small boxes\" and thus when calculating our loss function we would like the emphasis to be placed on getting small boxes more exact. The bounding box width and height are normalized by the image width and height and thus are also bounded between $0$ and $1$. An L2 loss is applied during training.\n",
