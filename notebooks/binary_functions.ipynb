An XOr function should return a true value if the two inputs are not equal and a false value if they are equal. All possible inputs and predicted outputs are shown below:\n",

        "Like all ANNs, the perceptron is composed of a network of units, which are analagous to biological neurons. A unit can receive an input from other units. On doing so, it takes the sum of all values received and decides whether it is going to forward a signal on to other units to which it is connected. This is called activation. The [activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function) uses some means or other to reduce the sum of input values to a 1 or a 0 (or a value very close to a 1 or 0) in order to represent activation or lack thereof. Another form of unit, known as a bias unit, always activates, typically sending a hard coded 1 to all units to which it is connected.\n",

Here a bias unit is depicted by a dashed circle, while other units are shown as blue circles. There are two non-bias input units representing the two binary input values for XOr. Any number of input units can be included.\n",

There are no connections between units in the input layer. Instead, all units in the input layer are connected directly to the output unit.\n",

The products of the input layer values and their respective weights are parsed as input to the non-bias units in the hidden layer. Each non-bias hidden unit invokes an activation function — usually the classic [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) in the case of the XOr problem — to squash the sum of their input values down to a value that falls between 0 and 1 (usually a value very close to either 0 or 1). The outputs of each hidden layer unit, including the bias unit, are then multiplied by another set of respective weights and parsed to an output unit. The output unit also parses the sum of its input values through an activation function — again, the sigmoid function is appropriate here — to return an output value falling between 0 and 1. This is the predicted output."

In practice, trying to find an acceptable set of weights for an MLP network manually would be an incredibly laborious task. In fact, it is [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness) (Blum and Rivest, 1992). However, it is fortunately possible to learn a good set of weight values automatically through a process known as backpropagation. This was first demonstrated to work well for the XOr problem by Rumelhart et al. (1985).\n",
        "The backpropagation algorithm begins by comparing the actual value output by the forward propagation process to the expected value and then moves backward through the network, slightly adjusting each of the weights in a direction that reduces the size of the error by a small degree. Both forward and back propagation are re-run thousands of times on each input combination until the network can accurately predict the expected output of the possible inputs using forward propagation.\n",

We can therefore expect the trained network to be 100% accurate in its predictions and there is no need to be concerned with issues such as [bias and variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff) in the resulting model."
