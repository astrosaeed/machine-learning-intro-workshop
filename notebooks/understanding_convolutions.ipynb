Convolutions allow us to do this transformation with only $9$ parameters, with each output feature, instead of “looking at” every input feature, only getting to “look” at input features coming from roughly the same location.

For a grid with an vertical edge, there is a difference between the pixels to the left and right of the edge, and the kernel computes that difference to be non-zero, activating and revealing the edges. The kernel only works only a $3×3$ grids at a time, detecting anomalies on a local scale, yet when applied across the entire image, is enough to detect a certain feature on a global scale, anywhere in the image!\n",

One of the most powerful tools to come out of that is [Feature Visualization using optimization](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/). The idea at core is simple: optimize a image (usually initialized with random noise) to activate a filter as strongly as possible. This does make intuitive sense: if the optimized image is completely filled with edges, that’s strong evidence that’s what the filter itself is looking for and is activated by. Using this, we can peek into the learnt filters, and the results are stunning:\n",
