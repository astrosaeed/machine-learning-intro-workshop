Hard attention is when, instead of weighted average of all hidden states, we use attention scores to select a single hidden state. The selection is an issue, because we could use a function like argmax to make the selection, but it is not differentiable (we are selecting an index corresponding to max score when we use argmax and nudging the weights to move the scores a little as part of backprop will not change this index selection) and therefore more complex techniques are employed. Note, the [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/xuc15.pdf) uses hard attention in an image captioning context, so “the encoder hidden states” are really the “feature vectors” generated by a CNN.\n",

So determining what role the word plays require us to investigate how the prepositions like “to” are used in such sentences. The paper introduces a “Latent Attention” model to do this.\n",

        "For online tasks, such as real time speech recognition, where we do not have the luxury of processing through an entire sequence this paper by Jaitly et al introduced the Neural Transducer that makes incremental prediction while processing blocks of input at a time, as opposed to encoding or generating attention over the entire input sequence.\n",
        "The input sequence is divided into multiple blocks of equal length (except possibly the last block) and the Neural Transducer model computes attention only for the inputs in the current block, which is then used to generate the output corresponding to that block. The connection with prior blocks exists only via the hidden state connections that are part of the RNN on the encoder and decoder side. While this is similar to an extent to the local attention described earlier, there is no explicit “position alignment” as described there.\n",

        "Refer back to *Fig 1*, an illustration of the base introductory attention model we saw in the earlier post. A generalized abstraction of alignment is that it is like querying the memory as we generate the output. The memory is some sort of representation of the input and the query is some sort of representation of output. In Fig 1, the memory or collection of keys was the encoder hidden states “h”, the blue nodes, and query was the current decoder hidden state “s”, the green nodes. The derived alignment score is then multiplied with “values” — another representation of the input, the gold nodes in *Fig 1*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Area attention is when attention is applied on to an “area”, not necessarily just one item like a vanilla attention model. “Area” is defined as a group of structurally adjacent items in the memory (i.e. the input sequence in a one dimensional input like sentence of words). An area is formed by combining adjacent items in the memory. In 2-D case like an image, the area will be any rectangular subset within the image.\n",

        "The “key” vector for an area can be defined simply as the mean vector of the key of each item in the area. In a sequence to sequence translation task, this would be the mean of each of the hidden state vectors involved in the area. In the definition under “Simple Key Vector” in Fig 11, ”k” is the hidden state vector. If we are defining an area containing 3 adjacent words, then the mean vector is the mean of the hidden state vectors generated after each of the three words in the encoder.\n",

        "The “value” on the other hand is defined as the sum of all value vectors in the area. In our basic example, this will again be the encoder hidden state vectors corresponding to the three words for which the area is being defined.\n",

        "We can also define a richer representation of the key vector that takes into consideration not just the mean, but also the standard deviation and shape vector as explained in the Fig 11. Shape vector here is defined as the concatenation of height and width vectors, which in turn are created from actual width and height numbers projected as vectors using embedding matrices, which I presume are learnt with the model. The key is derived as an output of a single layer perceptron that takes mean, std dev and shape vectors as input.\n",

If we are using a encoder-decoder RNN as seen in Fig 1, then plugging the derived area based key and value vectors in place of those in Fig 1 will make it an area based attention model."
