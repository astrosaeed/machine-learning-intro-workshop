This hidden vector at the end of every step is understood to represent the context of all prior inputs. In other words, the last hidden state represents the context of the entire sequence.\n",

Or even in English, where we can change word order depending on what we want to emphasize. Sometimes even in practical applications, say while processing a patient’s history in diagnosis prediction models, the inter-event relationships are as, if not more, important than the actual event sequence itself.\n",

So that’s that!).This strict sequential nature of processing is perhaps the ***first drawback***.\n"

Given the sequential nature of the operations, if the input sequence is of length “n”, it requires “n” sequential operations to arrive at the final hidden state (i.e. calculate h1, h2 etc till hn). We cannot perform these operations in parallel as h1 is a prerequisite to calculate h2.
