Besides dealing with the gigantic data of all kinds and shapes, the target turnaround time of the analysis part for the big data has been reduced significantly. Not only has this speed and efficiency helped in the immediate analysis of the Big Data but also in identifying new opportunities. This, in turn, has lead to smarter business moves, more efficient operations, higher profits, and happier customers.\n",
