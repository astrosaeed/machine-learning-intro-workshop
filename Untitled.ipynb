    "In this post, I'll discuss an overview of deep learning techniques for object detection using convolutional neural networks. Object detection is useful for understanding what's in an image, describing both what is in an image and where those objects are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there's two different approaches for this task â€“ we can either make a fixed number of predictions on grid (one stage) or leverage a proposal network to find objects and then use a second network to fine-tune these proposals and output a final prediction (two stage).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, I'll discuss the one-stage approach towards object detection; a follow-up post will then discuss the two-stage approach. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, which I'll discuss in the respective blog posts.\n"
